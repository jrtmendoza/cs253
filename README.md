Code repository for the final project on CS253 Computer Security handled by Dr. Susan Pancho-Festin

# Cryptography Exercises using OpenSSL 
1. To get started, clone the repository: 

$ git clone https://github.com/jrtmendoza/cs253.git

2. Set up the environment by executing first ./make 

3. Execute the cs253-encrypt
 
$ bash ./cs253-encrypt.sh

The script requires Internet connectivity to successfully run. Two directories will be created on the same directory where the script is invoked. The first routine in the script will download the LENA image from a remote URL.   

4. Verify the correctness of the encryption procedure by running ./cs253-check.sh
